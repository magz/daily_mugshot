<h1>Daily Mugshot Terms of Service</h1><br>
Updated: 10/22/2007<br>

By using or accessing this website, or any website hosted at the Daily Mugshot.com domain name (the "Site"), or by using any of the content hosting and sharing services provided via the Site (including without limitation the Daily Mugshot APIs) ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and by the Privacy Policy of Daily Mugshot ("Daily Mugshot"), which are collectively referred to as the "Agreement." Please read the terms of this Agreement carefully. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, then you may not use or access the Site or any of the Services.
<br>
<br>
Daily Mugshot may, in its sole discretion, modify this Agreement from time to time, and may modify, suspend, or terminate the Site and Services, for any reason, and without notice. Each revision will be marked with a revision date and will be posted on the Site. Daily Mugshot recommends that you review these terms from time to time to note any changes. Although you may be asked to indicate your assent to the terms of this Agreement only once (e.g., when you register for a Daily Mugshot account), the terms of this Agreement, as modified by Daily Mugshot from time to time, will govern all use of the Site and Services. By continuing to use or access the Site or any of the Services, you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service in effect at the time of such use or access.
<br>
<br>
1. Description of the Services
<br>
Daily Mugshot provides its Registered Users (defined below) with the ability to host a variety of content, including without limitation images ("Content") that Registered Users own or to which they have the necessary rights ("User Content"), in order to share User Content via the Web on, for example, auction websites such as eBay, classified advertising websites, online journals, blogs, message boards, personal websites, social networking sites, and online photo albums.
<br>
<br>
Although the Site and Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Daily Mugshot. Also, although Daily Mugshot will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, Daily Mugshot reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by Daily Mugshot in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Daily Mugshot encourages you to maintain your own backup of your User Content. In other words, Daily Mugshot is not a backup service. As discussed further in Section 8, Daily Mugshot will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content.
<br>
<br>
2. Accounts and Passwords
<br>
In order to access certain features of the Site and the Services, and to post Content, you must create a Daily Mugshot account. You may create an account on the Registration Page. Once you have created an account, you will be a "Registered User." Registered Users are limited to one free account per person.  Your Daily Mugshot account is solely for your own personal use and benefit. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Site and Services. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party nor to permit any third party to use your Daily Mugshot account. You agree to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your password, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Daily Mugshot of any unauthorized use of your password. In registering and creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information, and to promptly update that information as necessary. Daily Mugshot will have no liability for failure to deliver notices that result from inaccurate account information.
<br>
<br>
Daily Mugshot reserves the right to disable direct linking on accounts that are using excessive bandwidth or otherwise abusing the system. Daily Mugshot has the right to change its file size, bandwidth, or storage limitations without notice.
<br>
<br>
You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the options page. Daily Mugshot reserves the right at all times to terminate your account, and delete any and all Content, in whole or in part, for any reason including without limitation a breach of any part of this Agreement
<br>
<br>
3. Your License to Daily Mugshot
<br>
Daily Mugshot does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content that you choose to post to the Site. After posting User Content to the Site, you continue to retain all ownership or license rights in your User Content and you continue to have the right to use your User Content as you did prior to such posting. However, by posting or making User Content available through the Site or via the Services, you hereby grant to Daily Mugshot a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, prepare derivative works from, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform (whether by means of a digital audio transmission or otherwise) and process your User Content, or any part of it, solely on and through the Site and Services, including without limitation (a) adapting the format of your User Content (for example by encoding or transcoding) for suitable display on the Site; and (b) displaying, in Daily Mugshot's sole discretion, your public User Content in search results generated by the Daily Mugshot search engine. In addition, where you have made your User Content public, posted a link to your User Content on another website or otherwise shared a link to your User Content, you grant to Daily Mugshot a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to sublicense the right to copy, modify, prepare derivative works from, and distribute your User Content as necessary to perform the Services, including without limitation the printing services offered by Partner Sites. In connection with the above license, you provide your consent for Daily Mugshot personnel, including Daily Mugshot contractors and service providers, to view your User Content at any time for the purpose of providing the Services and filtering content that violates this Agreement. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all Content you submit to the Site or provide to the Service. You represent that you either own the User Content or have the rights necessary to grant Daily Mugshot this license.
<br>
<br>
Your license to Daily Mugshot with respect to any particular piece of User Content will terminate once you or Daily Mugshot remove it from the Site.
<br>
<br>
4. Daily Mugshot's Limited License to You
<br>
Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Daily Mugshot grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access, view and print public Content, only for your personal, non-commercial use. With the exception of your User Content, you may not distribute any Content to third parties, use any Content commercially (except as may be permitted by a separate license explicitly attached to a particular piece of Content), or otherwise copy, modify, distribute, publicly display or perform any Content (except as such acts may be permitted by a separate license explicitly attached to such Content).

Daily Mugshot may assign its rights and delegate its duties under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of all, or substantially all, of its assets relating to this Agreement. The failure of Daily Mugshot at any time to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same unless the same is waived in writing.

The headings and captions are for convenience only and are not to be used in the interpretation of this Agreement.
