Hey there <%= @authuser.login%>,
<br><br>

It looks like you have not taken your daily mugshot in about three days.
<br><br>

If you just forgot, then this is a reminder, and please feel free to get a Daily Mugshot Reminder App, found at: http://www.dailymugshot.com/main/get_reminder
<br><br>

If you want to go straight to taking your mugshot: http://www.dailymugshot.com/new_pic
<br><br>

If the service did not work well enough for you, please tell us why -- we really (really) value feedback.  Feedback@dailymugshot.com
<br><br>

(NOTE, this email comes about three days after your last mugshot, so you should not use it as your primary reminder!)
<br><br>

Thank you, and hope to see you on the site again soon!
<br><br>

Daily Mugshot
